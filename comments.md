## Comments

### Posting comments

To contribute to a thread, enter your comment into the comment form at the bottom of a thread and click the **Post** button. If Loomio has emailed you a comment, you can also reply directly from your email and your message will appear in the thread.

### Markdown

Loomio uses **Markdown** to let you format text and embed images. For more information on how to use Markdown, read [this guide](https://www.loomio.org/markdown).

### Attaching files

You can attach files to comments using the attachment button next to the **Post** button on the comment form. You will be prompted to select a file from your device.

### @mentioning group members

If you want to get the attention of a specific person in your group, type **@** into the comment field, followed by their name. As you type, a menu will appear, listing the members in your group that match that name. Select the member you want, then **Post** your comment. They will be notified that you’ve mentioned them in a comment.

### Editing a comment

By default, groups are configured so that a comment can only be edited until someone else contributes a comment to the thread. Group coordinators can also [configure groups to allow users to edit their comments at any time](https://www.loomio.org/help#group-permissions). If you are able to edit your comment, the **Edit comment **option is in the **Comment options** dropdown.

 

### Liking a comment

You can show another member of your group that you appreciate or understand what they’ve said by using the **Like** button below the comment. This will add your name to the list of people who like the comment. You can undo the **Like** action by clicking **Unlike** on the comment.

### Deleting a comment

You can delete your own comments by selecting the **Delete comment** option from the **Comment options** dropdown. Group coordinators can delete any comment in the group.
