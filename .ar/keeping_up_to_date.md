## Notifications

Notifications control how much you hear from a group or a specific discussion thread. There are four settings for both group notifications and thread notifications.

### Group notifications

Your current group notifications setting will appear in a **Group notifications** card on your group page, underneath the **Members card**. You can change your group notifications setting by clicking the **Change** link inside the **Group notifications** card, and selecting one of the four options:

* **Email everything**: You will be emailed whenever there is activity (comments, votes, new threads, proposals, and proposal outcomes) in this group.

* **Email new threads and proposals**: You will be emailed about new threads and proposals (i.e. when a proposal is started, about to close or when a proposal outcome is created). **Email proposals** is the default for new groups.

* **No emails**: You won't be emailed about activity in this group, but you'll see new group activity on your [**Unread**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads) and Recent pages.

* **Mute group**: You won't be emailed about this group, and it will be removed from your [**Unread**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads) and Recent pages.

### Thread notifications

When you start a new thread, it will inherit a default notifications setting from its group. Your current thread notifications setting will appear in a **Thread notifications** card on the thread page. You can change your thread notifications setting by clicking the **Change** link inside the **Thread notifications** card, and selecting one of the four options:


* **Email everything**: You will be emailed whenever there is activity (comments, new proposals, votes and proposal outcomes) in this thread.

* **Email proposals**: You will be emailed when a proposal is started, about to close or when a proposal outcome is created.

* **No emails**: You won't be emailed about this thread.

* **Mute thread**: You won't be emailed about this thread unless someone @mentions you. It will be removed from your [**Unread**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads) and Recent pages.

You can mute threads from thread previews that display on the group page, Recent Threads page and Unread page by hovering over the thread preview and selecting the **Mute** option. You can mark threads as read by selecting the **Mark as read** option. Marking a thread as read will remove it from your [**Unread**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads) page.

If you have thread notifications for a particular thread set to **Email everything**, you can reply to any comments you receive directly via email and your replies will be posted in the Loomio thread. You can also choose to view the comment in the context of the thread on Loomio by clicking the **view it on www.loomio.org** link in the footer of the email.


## Email settings

Your **Email settings** page enables you to set default email notification settings for groups and threads. To visit your **Email settings** page, select the **Email settings** option from the user menu in the navigation bar.

## Yesterday on Loomio

The **Yesterday on Loomio** email is a daily summary of content you haven't read from the previous day. The email contains everything that is not muted. You can turn this on or off from the **Email settings** page.
