## Updating your personal settings
You can update the name, username, email address and language settings associated with your account by editing the corresponding fields on your profile page, and clicking **Update profile**.

## Uploading a profile photo
When you first create a Loomio account, your initials will be the default image associated with your profile. You can upload a profile photo by clicking **Change picture** in the **Picture** section of your profile page. If you have a [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) you can set that as your profile picture by selecting **Use Gravatar**.

## Language settings
Loomio is available in many languages. It will detect your browser’s language settings, or you can manually set your preferred language by visiting your [profile page](#your-user-profile) and selecting your language from the **Language** dropdown.

## Usernames
Your username is the name people will use to mention ([@mention](comments.html#-mentioning-group-members)) you in comments. You can change your username by editing the **Username** field on your [profile page](#your-user-profile) and clicking **Update profile**.

## Changing your password
If you are logged in to Loomio you can change your password by visiting your profile page and clicking **Change your password**. If you are logged out then you can visit the [**Forgot your password?**](https://www.loomio.org/users/password/new) page.

## Deactivating your account
If you are not the sole coordinator of any groups you can deactivate your account by visiting your [profile page](#your-user-profile) and clicking **Deactivate account**. If you are the sole coordinator of a group you will be prevented from deactivating your account until you’ve appointed another group coordinator, or archived the group.

Once your account has been deactivated:

* you will no longer be listed as a member of any groups
* comments, proposals and discussions you’ve made will remain but your name will be removed from them
* you will no longer receive Loomio-related emails
* you will need to [contact us](https://loomio.org/contact) to reactivate your account

## Reactivating your account
To reactivate a deactivated account, [contact the Loomio team](https://loomio.org/contact).

## Leaving a group
