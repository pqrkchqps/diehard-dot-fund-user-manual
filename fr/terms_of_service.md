* the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content; 
* the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing); 
* the Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party; 
* your group is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other groups and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;

* and you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by Diehard.Fund or otherwise.

## Disputes and choice of law

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Diehard.Fund and You concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by a Diehard.Fund Cooperative member, or by the posting by Diehard.Fund of a revised version. Any and all disputes arising of this agreement, termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Wellington, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators and Mediators Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either You or Diehard.Fund. Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.

4. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Diehard.Fund may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition.
