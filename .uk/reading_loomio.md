# Reading Diehard.Fund

## Recent Threads

**Recent Threads** is the landing page when you sign into Diehard.Fund. It gives you an overview of the most recent activity happening in your groups. The **Recent Threads** page displays content from your groups in a prioritised list. Open proposals are at the top, followed by **Starred** threads, then all of the threads from your groups, sorted by most recent activity; **Today**, **Yesterday**,** This month**,** Older than a month**.

If a thread or proposal title is **bold** then new activity has taken place there since you last visited. Numbers in parentheses after titles reflect how many new comments or votes have been posted since you last visited. Proposals will show a pie graph, with your position on the proposal superimposed on the graph. If you haven’t yet stated a position, this will show a question mark. 

## Starred threads

Clicking the star icon on a thread preview marks that thread ‘starred’. Use stars to mark certain threads as important. Only you can see if you’ve starred a thread.

## Filter threads

The **Filter Threads **dropdown lets you choose to see:

* **Recent Threads:** all threads and proposals with recent activity.

* **Participating threads**: only the threads and proposals which you’ve participated in.

* **Muted: **only the threads which you’ve previously [muted](keeping_up_to_date.html#thread-volume).

## Unread Threads

This page shows all the threads and proposals that have new content since you last visited, sorted by group. You can click **Mark as read **on a thread preview to clear it from this page without actually visiting the thread. You can also [mute](keeping_up_to_date.html#thread-volume)** **threads here.
